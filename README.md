# E-commerce-customer-segmentation

Problem Statement
As an e-commerce platform, it is very important to profile your customers, dividing your clientele base into groups based on their needs and expectations. Grouping will help us come up with dedicated marketing strategies and will aid us in recommending products to different user bases. In this project, we are interested in analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by âˆ¼4000 customers over a period of one year (1/12/2010 to 9/12/2011). Based on this analysis, we would like to develop models to group the 4000 customers into different buckets. Such a model must take into account the similarity between the products purchased between the users (i.e. a user might purchase 2 different products which are very similar to each other), the spending patterns of a user, their meta information, etc. 

Customer Conversion Prediction

Problem Statement
You are working for a new-age insurance company and employ mutiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to your customers. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of the most effective way to reach out to people however they incur a lot of cost. Hence, it is important to identify the customers that are most likely to convert beforehand so that they can be specifically targeted via call. We are given the historical marketing data of the insurance company and are required to build a ML model that will predict if a client will subscribe to the insurance. 
Features: 
age (numeric)
job : type of job
marital : marital status
educational_qual : education status
call_type : contact communication type
day: last contact day of the month (numeric)
mon: last contact month of year
dur: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)
num_calls: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client 
prev_outcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")
Output variable (desired target):y - has the client subscribed to the insurance?


Minimum Requirements
It is not sufficient to just fit a model - the model must be analysed to find the important factors that contribute towards the conversion rate. F1-Score must be used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the models.
